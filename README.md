Blockchain server can be started by runnning the BlockchainServer.java file.

This is an independent project carried out in full by me.

Conducted in order to learn more about networking through a more modern lense, the blockchain.

The server is capable of handling the sharing of information between many machines
as long as each machine knows about at least one other machine in the network. Network is
capable of detecting differences in the information stored at each machine, deciding on a
consensus and performing updates on the right machines as required, while only sending the
minimum amount of information over the network to perform the update.
